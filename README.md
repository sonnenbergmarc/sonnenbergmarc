### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting used to not having any school projects to work on. I'm also working on my Website Portfolio and polishing a Laravel project from school.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about C++, Laravel and React.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any projects. I'm always looking to learn something new or to help in the things that I have experience in.
